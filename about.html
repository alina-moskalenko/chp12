                <h2>Anais Shole</h2>
                <p>
                  5 years ago, Anais was traveling along the California Coast
                  with a few of her friends. They're next stop Zephyr and she
                  had heard from others that it was the most beautiful places
                  they'd see. Once they arrived, she knew they were telling the
                  truth. With unbelievable cliffs-to-ocean views and exciting
                  trails all around, she knew she never wanted to leave. After
                  that trip, Anais immediately starting planning and creating
                  her idea of a permanent camping spot along that magnificent
                  coastline. With the help of her partner, Wanda, she was able
                  to build this beautiful resort and a community as in love with
                  it as she is.

                <h2>Wanda Kiwselph</h2>
                <p>
                  Wanda has always had a knack for seeing an idea and making it
                  come to life. So it's no surprise when her partner Anais told
                  her after a trip that she wanted to build a luxury resort on
                  the pacific coast, she was on board. They had tried camping in
                  luxury yurts for an anniversary the year prior and thought
                  that it would be perfect for their own vacation getaway. After
                  the construction, their next anniversary was spent in their
                  own yurt on site and they have loved it ever since.

                <h2>Geraldine Way</h2>
                <p>
                  During the planning process, Anais and Wanda knew that despite
                  their love of nature, they wanted to have someone who had a
                  passion and knowledge of the flora, fauna, and marine life to
                  guide their guest through their experience at Pacific Trails
                  Resort. After looking for a while, they realized the expert
                  they needed was right under their noses! They looked no
                  further than Anais's old childhood best friend, Geraldine.
                  Geraldine is a certified kayak and surf instructor who has
                  been hiking along the Pacific for more than a decade. She
                  studied ecology at UCLA and truly can answer almost any
                  question about the local wildlife. Her favorite's are the
                  birds, including Black Oystercatcher's, Savannah Sparrows, and
                  California Scrub-Jay. It's hard not to enjoy birdwatching once
                  you hear her talk about them.
